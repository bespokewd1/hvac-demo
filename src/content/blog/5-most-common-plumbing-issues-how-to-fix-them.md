# **5 Most Common Plumbing Issues & How to Fix Them**

Plumbing problems can be frustrating, costly, and disruptive to your daily routine. The good news? Many common issues can be prevented or quickly fixed if caught early. Here are the **five most common plumbing problems**, along with expert tips on how to handle them.

## **1. Dripping Faucets**

ðŸ”§ **Why It Happens:** A worn-out washer, O-ring, or corroded valve seat is often the culprit behind a leaky faucet.

ðŸ’¡ **How to Fix It:**

* Turn off the water supply.
* Disassemble the faucet and inspect the washer and O-ring.
* Replace any damaged parts and reassemble.

ðŸ’° **Why It Matters:** A single dripping faucet can waste up to **3,000 gallons of water per year**, increasing your water bill unnecessarily.

## **2. Clogged Drains**

ðŸ”§ **Why It Happens:** Hair, grease, soap scum, and food debris build up over time, blocking the pipes.

ðŸ’¡ **How to Fix It:**

* Use a plunger or drain snake to clear minor blockages.
* Pour a mixture of 

  **hot water, baking soda, and vinegar**

   to dissolve buildup.
* For stubborn clogs, call a professional plumber to avoid damaging your pipes.

ðŸš¨ **Prevention Tip:** Install drain screens and avoid pouring grease or coffee grounds down the sink.

## **3. Running Toilet**

ðŸ”§ **Why It Happens:** A faulty flapper valve, broken fill tube, or imbalanced float can cause constant water flow.

ðŸ’¡ **How to Fix It:**

* Remove the tank lid and inspect the 

  **flapper**

  â€”if itâ€™s worn out, replace it.
* Check if the 

  **fill tube**

   is positioned correctly.
* Adjust the 

  **float**

   to ensure proper water level control.

ðŸ’° **Why It Matters:** A running toilet can waste **up to 200 gallons of water per day**, costing you more on utilities.

## **4. Low Water Pressure**

ðŸ”§ **Why It Happens:** Mineral deposits, pipe leaks, or issues with the main water line can restrict water flow.

ðŸ’¡ **How to Fix It:**

* Clean clogged 

  **showerheads**

   and faucets by soaking them in vinegar overnight.
* Check for 

  **hidden leaks**

   by turning off all taps and watching your water meterâ€”if it moves, you may have a leak.
* If the problem is throughout the house, contact your water supplier or a plumber for deeper inspection.

ðŸš¨ **Prevention Tip:** If you have hard water, install a **water softener** to reduce mineral buildup.

## **5. Burst Pipes**

ðŸ”§ **Why It Happens:** Freezing temperatures, aging pipes, or high water pressure can cause pipes to burst.

ðŸ’¡ **How to Fix It:**

* **Turn off the main water supply**

   immediately.
* Open faucets to drain excess water and reduce pressure.
* Wrap a burst section with 

  **pipe repair tape**

   or a 

  **patch kit**

   as a temporary fix.
* Call a plumber for a permanent repair or pipe replacement.

ðŸš¨ **Prevention Tip:** Insulate pipes in cold weather and avoid letting pressure build up in old pipes.

## **Final Thoughts**

Plumbing issues can start small but turn into major headaches if ignored. Regular maintenance and early fixes can save you time, money, and stress.
